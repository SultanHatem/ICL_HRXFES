ICL_HRXFES_01

Dataset collected and owned by Imperial College London - Dept of Bioengineering, Prof. Etienne Burdet, in the context of the EU-H2020 REHYB project (Grant Number: 871767). 

The dataset includes kinematic data extracted from healthy participants when performing a target tracking task with their wrist flexion/extension motion. The experiments are executed using a 1-DOF wrist robot and an electrical stimulation system acting on the wrist flexor and extensor muscles. The experiment follows a repeated measures design, where participants performed the task alone, with the help of robotic assistance, with the help of functional electrical stimulation and with the help of both robotic assistance and stimulation.

The participants first completed ten trials of the trajectory tracking task without assistance. They then completed four blocks of the trajectory tracking task, each block using one of four conditions of assistance: {robot+FES, robot, FES and no assistance}. The conditions were presented in random order, with each block containing 15 trials consisting of 15s of target tracking and a 3s rest. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Imperial College London (approval number: 21IC6935). 

The dataset contains one .csv file per participant who performed the target tracking task. 
The following data is available: time (s), subject angular position (deg), target angular position (deg), motor torque (Nm), Robot On flag, FES amplitude (mA - positive when the flexor is stimulated and negative when the extensor is), Flexor FES amplitude (mA), Extensor FES amplitude (mA), FES On flag, Condition index (0=unassisted baseline trials, 1=unassisted evaluation trials, 4=No assistance condition, 5=Robot assistance condition, 6=FES assistance condition, 7=Robot+FES assistance condition), Trial number, Rest flag.
